# Kabo-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
Hello! My name is Vincent Kabo and I'm a student in the Telling Stories with Data course. I am a second year graduate student enrolled in the Master of Science in Health Care Policy & Management course at Carnegie Mellon University. I received my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Nothwood University, MI.
I seek to work as a Community Health Manager with a healthcare organization committed to addressing the needs of at-risk populations through research and policy.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to effectively use visualizations to take complex data and break it down for the reader. I plan on using the skills learned in this course to effectively tell stories through data in order to make my future research and community health initiatives successful.

This is where my cool data visualizations will go!
