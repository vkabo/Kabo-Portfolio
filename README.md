# Kabo-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
Hello! My name is Vincent Kabo and I'm a student in the Telling Stories with Data course. I am a second year graduate student enrolled in the Master of Science in Health Care Policy & Management course at Carnegie Mellon University. I received my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Nothwood University, MI.
I seek to work as a Community Health Manager with a healthcare organization committed to addressing the needs of at-risk populations through research and policy.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to effectively use visualizations to take complex data and break it down for the reader. I plan on using the skills learned in this course to effectively tell stories through data in order to make my future research and community health initiatives successful.

# Portfolio
This is where my cool data visualizations will go!
